This repository contains the necessary files for the final project for DSP 539. The project uses data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study to to model and predict the likelihood death based upon a certain set of covariates. 
There are 6 files in this repository: 

NHEFS.csv: this is the dataset that that project is based on.

Final Report.pdf: This pdf reports the methods, results, and conclusions of the project. It includes an abstract, introduction, data description, methods, results, conclusion and future work, and author's notes section. This is the recommended document to begin with to gain the deepest insight about the project.

Final_Graphs.rmd/.pdf: These two files represent the .rmd file and its corresponding .pdf file. Final_Graphs contains all the graphs that were produced for data visualization for this project. All variables were plotted against the number of deaths as a single variable. Every two variable combination were also plotted against the number of deaths. No graphs were inserted into the Fianl Report but instead can be referenced within this document by their figure number. 

Final_Analysis.rmd/.pdf: These two files represent the .rmd file and its corresponding .pdf file. Final_Analysis contains all the analyses that were used to produce the models and their prediction accuracy. This includes the glm functions for both the full and reduced model, with their corresponding summaries and ANOVAs. This file also contains the methods used in predicting the likelihood of death with their accuracy for both models.
